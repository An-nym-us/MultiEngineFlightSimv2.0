# MultiEngineFlightSim

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

# Overview

This project is a flight simulator that will take advantage of Deep Reinforcement learning to help improve flight hovering and response to environmental conditions. This will utilize the Unreal Engine 5 physics engine and workspace to simulate an accurate full flight system. Future versions will include object avoidance and full axis control to improve its realism within the simulation.
